	In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Services or any other products or services provided by us (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). &amp;nbsp;Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. &amp;nbsp;All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. &amp;nbsp;Any court in Los Angeles, California may enforce the arbitrator’s award. &amp;nbsp;The arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the “JAMS Rules”). &amp;nbsp;Such disputes will be resolved by the arbitrator as determined under the JAMS Rules. &amp;nbsp;The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
